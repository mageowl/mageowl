## 👋 Hello! You've found my profile!

I'm a 13 year old game developer/pixel artist in training. I'm most fluent in  JavaScript. My favorite animal is an owl 🦉, hence my website. Most of my games are made in JavaScript, but I've used Godot and Unity too. For art I use [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org). Hope you like my games.
