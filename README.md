## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! You've found my profile!

I'm a 10 year old game developer/pixel artist in training. I'm most fluent in  JavaScript. My favorite animal is an owl ðŸ¦‰, hence my website. Most of my games are made in JavaScript, but I've used Godot and Unity too. For art I use [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org). Hope you my games.
